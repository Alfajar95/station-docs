Under each denomination, Station will show you which chain your asset is currently on. For optimum routing, make sure you are aware which of chain your asset is on. When you choose an asset, Station will route the asset based on the chain on which the asset is currently held.

Congratulations, you've just completed a swap!

<Admonition type="tip" icon="⛓️" title="Fee top-ups">

If your swap requires fees to be paid in other assets that you don't have, Station will prompt you to top up your fees. Station will guide you through this process, swapping for enough of an asset to pay for fees. Station estimates the fees, allows you to choose how much of the fee token you want to swap for, and then performs the swap, enabling you to continue with your transaction.
