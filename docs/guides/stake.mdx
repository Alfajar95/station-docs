## Stake

You can stake your assets in Station to earn staking rewards. Follow the steps below to learn how to stake. For more information on staking, visit the [Terra Docs](https://docs.terra.money/learn/protocol#staking). 

1. Visit [https://station.money/](https://station.money/) in your browser and connect your Station wallet extension. 

2. In the menu on the left, click **Stake**.

2. On the Staking page you'll see a list of assets. The stakeable assets that you own will have a blue **Stake** button next to them. To stake an asset, select the asset by clicking the **Stake** button next to the asset you want to stake. 

<Admonition type="caution" icon="ðŸ’°" title="Unstaking periods">

When you stake your assets, you are locking them up in exchange for rewards. STaked assets cannot be traded freely. While you still own the assets you stake, you will not be able to trade them freely until you unstake them and wait for the unstaking period to end. Terra's unstaking period is 21 days, meaning you will have to wait 21 days to receive your Luna after ustaking it. The unstaking period varies depending on the chain the asset is staked to.
