When sending assets to another chain, Station will automatically route the asset. If the asset is not available on the chain you are trying to send to, a warning will appear. Be sure to read all warnings carefully. Some assets may need to be sent back to their origin chain before being sent to another chain.

Cross-chain transactions may also require gas tokens for the destination and origin chains. Station will evaluate your route and prompt you to purchase the correct gas tokens should you need them. Then, you can continue your cross-chain transaction.

## Receive

You can receive assets on any supported chain in your Station wallet. When you set up a wallet in Station, the app automatically generates all addresses that correspond to your wallet account on all supported chains. Station takes into account all assets across all your connected wallets. 

1. To receive assets to your address on a specific chain, open your Station browser extension and click **Receive**.
