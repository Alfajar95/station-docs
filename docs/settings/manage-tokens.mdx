# Manage tokens

You can control which assets appear in your Station wallet by following the guide below. Some tokens may need to be selected in your settings before they will appear. 

1. Open your Station browser extension and click the gear icon \(⚙\) in the upper right corner of the extension.

2. In the settings menu, click **Manage Tokens**. 

<img
    className="readme-img-sm"
    src="/img/screens/settings/settings-1.png"
    alt="settings"
/>

3. Enter the name of the token you want to see in your wallet and select the correct asset. Select **Only show whitelisted tokens** if you only want to be shown the tokens that you select.

Remember, the same asset may be on different chains, so select accordingly. The chain that the asset is on can be seen below the name of the asset.
